## Description
The Bank Loan Performance Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI project designed to provide insights into the performance of a bank's loan portfolio. This dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) related to loans, including total applications, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. It also segments the data into "Good Loans" and "Bad Loans," providing a clear understanding of performance trends and risk management.

## The dashboard offers multiple views, including:

Problem Statement
In the competitive financial landscape, banks need to monitor and evaluate the performance of their loan portfolios to ensure profitability and manage risk effectively. Traditional reporting methods are often time-consuming and fail to provide real-time, actionable insights.

## Key challenges include:

1.Tracking loan application trends and funding performance over time.
2.Identifying regional and demographic patterns in loan performance.
3.Differentiating between "Good Loans" (performing loans) and "Bad Loans" (defaulted loans) to assess overall portfolio health.
4.Analyzing customer behavior, including loan purposes, terms, and homeownership impact.

This project addresses these challenges by delivering a dynamic, interactive dashboard that provides instant, visual insights into key performance metrics.
